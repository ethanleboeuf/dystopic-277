# dystopic-277

This repository contains code for our AA277 final project.
We attempt to solve for the optimal patrol policy of a group of agents in a non-convex environment by simulating the problem as a POMDP "game" versus one or more adversaries.
The code in this repository is messy, disorganized, and hacky. It was meant as a proof of concept, and unfortunately did not accomplish that goal.
