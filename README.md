# dystopic-277

## Main Aspects (the two are mostly independent)

 - __Patrol__: scan a region as best as possible
   - Define successful detection
 - __Pursuit__: kill kill kill. No survivors
   - Define successful capture
   - Define failure condition
 
 ## Necessary tools:
 
  - Environment representation (options)
      1) A graph with underlying geometry
      2) Geometry with an underlying graph
      3) A graph with no associated geometry and some extra plotting machinery
    
 - Graph traversal
   - Dynamics

 - Agent Controls
   - Stochasticity
   - MDPs? POMDPs?
   - Communication/distribution
 
 - Intruder Controls
   - Omnicient? 
   - Relative properties?
   - Multiple intruders?
   - Intrusion probability 
   - Goal
